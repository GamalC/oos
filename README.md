OVERVIEW
OOS (pronounces 'Ohs') [name subject to change] is an app that allows persons to create programmes (as in a list of items that will be done at a formal event). It provides facilities to add items (such as songs, anthems etc) and their content to the database. These items can then be accessed and added to a particular programme easily. The final programme can then be saved as a PDF document, PowerPoint presentation etc for easy viewing (e.g by projector) and printing. Programmes and items can be shared and accessed by all interested parties for viewing and/or editing.

RESOURCES:
The app has only two resources: Items and Programmes.

An Item resource stores the content of the item such as text representing lyrics and a title by which it is known and represented on the Programme. In viewing an item it can be extended (in which case the content is shown) or collapsed (in which case only the title is shown).

A Programme resource is simply an ordered collection of items and subitems. The order represents the sequential order in which they are expected to be done at the event.
